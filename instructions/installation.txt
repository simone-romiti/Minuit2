1 - Download the latest version from the Minuit website:
    http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/snapshot/work-packages/mathlibs/minuit/
		
		(alternatively you can check if the release you are looking for is already in the present repository)
		
2 - Now, in the directory where you downloaded the archive, extract Minuit2 with:
    
		mv Minuit-x-x-x.tar.gz   Minuit-x-x-x.tar 
		tar xvf Minuit2-5.34.14.tar 

		NOTE: Don't follow the instructions on the webpage
		http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/snapshot/work-packages/mathlibs/minuit/gettingStarted/autoconf.html
		because you'd get the following error:
		
		------------------------------------------
		>>> tar -zxf Minuit2-5.34.14.tar.gz 

		gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
		tar: Child returned status 1
		tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
		------------------------------------------
		
		The same happens even if you rename the .tar.gz file as above. 
		
3 - From now on you can follow the instructions on the webpage. 
    In most cases you can simply do:
		
		./configure
		make
		make check
		
4 - Run a test program. On the webpage the name of the executable is not updated. Simply call:

     test/MnTutorial/test_Minuit2_Quad4FMain

5 - If everything went fine, you can place the present Minuit2/ folder wherever you want in your filesystem.
    A choice could be the /opt/ directory.
    Then give also the following command (eventually replacing /opt/ with your choice):
    
    sudo ln -s /opt/Minuit2/src/.libs/libMinuit2.so.0 /usr/local/lib/libMinuit2.so.0 
    
    This will create a symbolic link to the shared library needed for the linking process.
