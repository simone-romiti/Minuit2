(In the following it's assumed Minuit2 has been installed in /opt/)

Compiling:

CFLAGS = -I /opt/Minuit2/inc/

Linking:

During the installation of Minuit2 it is created a shared library 'libMinuit2.so.0'
This is the shared library needed to be linked with your objects in order to produce the executable.
(My guess is that Minuit2 developers chose this name in order to not conflict with the 'libMinuit2.so' possibly coming from the installation of ROOT)

LDFLAGS = -fopenmp -L /opt/Minuit2/src/.libs/  -lMinuit2

Note that the latter won't work until you place the shared library libMinuit2.so.0 in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib/ 
(see the installation instructions)
