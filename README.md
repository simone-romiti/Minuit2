# Minuit2 standalone

This repository contains:

- The releases of the minimization library Minuit2 :
      **releases/**

- The instructions to [install](./instructions/install.md) and [use](./instructions/usage.md) it :
      **instructions/**

- Examples of some C++ programs
      **examples/**

- A templated version of the library (in progress)
      **templated/**

I created it in order to simplify the installation process for novices (as I was) because it took me some time to figure out the exact installation process.
Apart from the templated/ folder, It doesn't contain much more that what is present in the [Minuit website](http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/snapshot/work-packages/mathlibs/minuit/).
