      releases/

      instructions/

- Examples of some C++ programs
      examples/

- A templated version of the library (in progress)
      templated/

I created it in order to simplify the installation process for novices (as I was).
Apart from the templated/ folder, It doesn't contain more that what is present in the Minuit website:
